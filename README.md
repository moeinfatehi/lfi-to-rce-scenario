# LFI to RCE Scenario (challenge)
This repository is a Dockerized php application containing a LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability which can lead to RCE (Remote Code Execution).<br><br>
The ideas behind the challenge are:</br>
* Bypass path traversal sanitization
* Execute OS command through LFI vulnerability.

# Quick Start Using Docker
**Using docker hub (Quickest):**
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> installed.</br>
2. Run this command to pull and run the image from docker hub:</br>`sudo docker run -d -p 9005:80 moeinfatehi/lfi-to-rce`
3. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9005">http://localhost:9005</a></br></br>

Help:
```
-d: detached mode (You can use terminal after running command
-p: specifies port (you can change 9005 to whatever you want. If you don't have a web server on your host, set it to 80)
```

**Using docker-compose:**  
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a> installed.</br>
2. Clone the repository</br>`git clone https://github.com/moeinfatehi/lfi-to-rce.git`
3. Open the main directory of the project (where docker-compose.yml file exists) and run: `docker-compose up`
4. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9005">http://localhost:9005</a>
